task1:
Write a DB Query.
Database Schema:
Consider an e-commerce database with the following schema.
● Users Table: (user_id, username, email, registration_date)
● Products Table: (product_id, product_name, price, stock_quantity)
● Orders Table: (order_id, user_id, order_date)
● OrderItems Table: (order_item_id, order_id, product_id, quantity)

SELECT
    Users.username,
    Users.email,
    SUM(order_idi.quantity * Products.price) AS total_amount_spent
FROM
    Users Users
JOIN
    Orders o ON Users.user_id = o.user_id
JOIN
    OrderItems oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN
    Products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE
    o.order_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY
    Users.user_id
HAVING
    total_amount_spent > 0;
